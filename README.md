# Unity With Visual Studio and Git

These are the files for Dan Vicarel's GDEX 2019 Presentation: "Supercharging Your Unity Workflow With Visual Studio and Git"

- Click `Clone or Download` then `Download ZIP` to get these files (or clone, if you already know some Git!)
- To make following the demos easier later, please download/install the following:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com)
  - [Visual Studio Tools for Unity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/visual-studio-tools-for-unity)
    - Select `Extensions > Manage Extensions` within Visual Studio
    - Search `Visual Studio Tools for Unity` under `Online`
    - Select `Download`
- If you don't already have Unity and Visual Studio installed, then try to just follow along. Both programs are large and take a long time to download/install.
